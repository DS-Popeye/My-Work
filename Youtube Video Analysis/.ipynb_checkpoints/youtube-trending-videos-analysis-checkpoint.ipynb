    "## Introduction\n",
    "YouTube is the most popular and most used video platfrom in the world today. YouTube has [a list of **trending videos**](https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending) that is updated constantly. Here we will use **Python** with some packages like **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** to analyze a dataset that was collected over 205 days. For each of those days, the dataset contains data about the trending videos of that day. It contains data about **more than `40,000` trending videos**. We will analyze this data to get insights into YouTube trending videos, to see what is common between these videos. Those insights might also be used by people who want to increase popularity of their videos on YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we will use is obtained from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new). It contains data about trending videos for many countries. Here we will analyze USA trending videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of the analysis\n",
    "We want to answer questions like:\n",
    "* How many views do our trending videos have? Do most of them have a large number of views? Is having a large number of views required for a video to become trending?\n",
    "* The same questions above, but applied to likes and comment count instead of views.\n",
    "* Which video remained the most on the trendin-videos list?\n",
    "* How many trending videos contain a fully-capitalized word in their titles?\n",
    "* What are the lengths of trending video titles? Is this length related to the video becoming trendy?\n",
    "* How are views, likes, dislikes, comment count, title length, and other attributes correlate with (relate to) each other? How are they connected?\n",
    "* What are the most common words in trending video titles?\n",
    "* Which YouTube channels have the largest number of trending videos?\n",
    "* Which video category (e.g. Entertainment, Gaming, Comedy, etc.) has the largest number of trending videos?\n",
    "* When were trending videos published? On which days of the week? at which times of the day?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table of contents\n",
    "* [Importing some packages](#import)\n",

    "    * [Likes histogram](#lh)\n",
    "    * [Comment count histogram](#ch)\n",
    "* [Description on non-numerical columns](#descnn)\n",
    "* [How many trending video titles contain capitalized word?](#cap)\n",

    "Here are the some of the results we extracted from the analysis:\n",
    "* We analyzed a dataset that contains information about YouTube trending videos for 205 days. The dataset was collected in 2017 and 2018. It contains **`40949`** video entry.\n",
    "* `71%` of trending videos have less than `1.5` million views, and **`91%`** have less than **`5`** million views.\n",
    "* `68%` of trending videos have less than `40,000` likes, and **`84%`** have less than **`100,000`** likes.\n",
    "* `67%` of trending videos have less than `4,000` comments, and **`93%`** have less than **`25,000`** comments.\n",
    "* Some videos may appear on the trending videos list on more than one day. Our dataset contains `40494` entries but not for `40494` unique videos but for `6351`unique videos.\n",
    "* Trending videos that have **`100,000,000`** views and more  have title length between `33` and `55` characters approximately.\n",
    "* The delimiters `-` and `|` were common in trending video titles.\n",
    "* The words 'Official', 'Video', 'Trailer', 'How', and '2018' were common also in trending video titles.\n",
    "* There is a strong positive correlation between the number of views and the number of likes of trending videos: As one of them increases, the other increases, and vice versa.\n",
    "* There is a strong positive correlation also between the number of likes and the number of comments, and a slightly weaker one between the number of dislikes and the number of comments.\n",
    "* The category that has the largest number of trending videos is **'Entertainment'** with `9,964` videos, followed by 'Music' category with `6,472` videos, followed by 'Howto & Style' category with `4146` videos.\n",
    "* On the opposite side, the category that has the smallest number of trending videos is 'Shows' with `57` videos, followed by 'Nonprofits & Activisim' with `57` videos, followed by 'Autos & Vehicles' with `384` videos.\n",
